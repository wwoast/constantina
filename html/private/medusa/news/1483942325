Longer News Items
Images, Paragraphs

<img src="/images/example.png" class="InlineNewsCenterFocus" />
<p>For longer news items, you can have embedded images that only appear when you expand the entry.</p>

<p>Just create a news entry with more than three paragraphs, and any image larger than 300&times;220px will automatically be hidden.</p>

<p>Images smaller than that can still be used for emphasis, and you can still put other images where-ever you want in a post.</p>
