Constantina is a blog platform that randomizes content. To get a basic idea,
visit http://www.codaworry.com, and refresh the page a handful of times.

Basics
------
constantina,py is a single Python script on the backend, and a series of static
webpages, javascript, and content on the frontend.

The backend script pulls files from subdirectories in a single WEB_ROOT folder. Some of these subdirectories store files that appear in set reverse-time
order, like news entries. Other subdirectories store media that appear with 
random spacing and random ordering, such as pictures, songs, and quotes. A 
MAX_ITEMS variable defines the total size of the page -- once MAX_ITEMS is 
reached, the page must trigger an AJAX event to load further content. 

The front end defines a single-column responsive layout for nearly any screen
size. This column will display "cards" of content in an infinitely-scrolling
list. A clickable event and a scroll-height event will both trigger AJAX calls
to load further content into the page.
